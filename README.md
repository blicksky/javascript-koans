## Clarity

A senior engineer was reviewied the code of a junior engineer, and suggested they replace the use of a `for` loop with a `forEach` call.

A staff engineer was reviewed the senior engineer's review and pointed out that the original `for` loop was actually more performant.

The junior engineer asked "Was it not clear and comprehensible the way it was originally written?"

The senior and staff engineers were thus enlightened.
