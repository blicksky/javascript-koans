## Clarity

A senior engineer was reviewied the code of a junior engineer, and suggested they replace the use of a `for` loop with a `forEach` call.

A staff engineer was reviewed the senior engineer's review and pointed out that the original `for` loop was actually more performant.

The junior engineer asked "Was it not clear and comprehensible the way it was originally written?"

The senior and staff engineers were thus enlightened.

## Promises

A mid-level developer was struggling to understand asynchronous coding in JavaScript.

A senior developer offered, "There is an article that may be of interest to you. It will take some time for me to find it. What would you like me to do when I find it."

"Email it to me," was the response.

"And what would you like me to do if I fail to find it?"

"Just email me to let me know, and I'll figure out how to handle it," replied the more junor developer.

"And after I've emailed you, will you please make sure tell me if it helped?"

"I promise," the other replied, and in that moment, was enlightened.

## Wildest Streams

In the days of A+, Staltz was showing a developer how to fulfill a Promise with a value.

"And what if I want to fulfill with an array of values?" asked the student.

"You simply fulfill with the array," replied the master.

"And what if I want to do something asynchronous with each result?" asked the student.

"You can map over the array with `Promises.map` or `Promises.all`" replied the master.

"And what if each value is available at a different time?" asked the student.

"What is your application?" asked the master.

"Streaming data," replied the student.

In that moment, Staltz was englightened.
