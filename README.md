# Javascript Koans

A collection of koans in the tradition of the
[AI Koans](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/koans.html), but for JavaScript.

Most koans are not meant to be self-evident. Unlike the subjects of most koans, you will not gain
instant enlightenment from a few shorts words. Koans are meant to be studied, considered,
meditated over, and most importantly, discussed with other students and masters.

## The Koans

Currently only available in US English at [koans/en/en-US/koans.md](koans/en/en-US/koans.md).

Please submit a Pull Request for any additions or modifications. Happy to consider new koans,
modifications to existing koans, and translations to other languages.
